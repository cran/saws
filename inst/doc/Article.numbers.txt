Article numbers are associated with the Article variable in the data sets (SDcorn and dietfat). Articles with a "*" are in the final database (see Fay, Freedman, Clifford, and Midthune, 1997, Cancer Research 57: 3979-3988). Articles numbered 0 are copied but are not appropriate for the database. Articles numbered 00 have been investigated  but not copied and are not appropriate for some reason. Notes on why the articles are not appropriate are given.
